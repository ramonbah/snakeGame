# Snake Game in iOS Swift

Welcome to my Snake Game! This game is developed for iOS using UIKit. It features multiple stages with increasing difficulty, providing a fun and engaging experience as you progress through the game.

## Game Stages

### Casual Stage
In this introductory mode, you'll control a single snake that eats simple fruits. This stage is designed for beginners to get acquainted with the gameplay mechanics. Your goal here is to focus on eating fruits and growing your snake.

### Easy Stage
The Easy Stage introduces a bit more complexity. Shadow snakes will appear when you eat fruits, adding a new twist to your gameplay. These shadow snakes are intended to help you practice and refine your skills.

### Normal Stage
Things heat up in the Normal Stage! Fruits will start moving around, and bombs will appear when you eat fruits. You’ll need to avoid these bombs while trying to catch the moving fruits to keep your snake growing.

### Hard Stage
Get ready for a challenge in the Hard Stage! Your snake can now pass through walls, and you’ll encounter larger moving fruits and more frequent bombs. Watch out for bombs thrown from outside the screen—they’ll keep you on your toes!

### Extreme Stage
The Extreme Stage is the ultimate test! It combines all the toughest elements: shadow snakes, moving fruits, and relentless thrown bombs. This stage is designed for the best players looking for an intense and thrilling challenge.

## Future Improvements

There are several enhancements planned for the game, including:
- Improved colors and visual effects
