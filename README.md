# Snake Game in iOS Swift

Welcome to my Snake Game! This game is developed for iOS using UIKit. It features multiple stages with increasing difficulty, providing a fun and engaging experience as you progress through the game.

## Game Stages

### Casual Stage
In this mode, you’ll control a single snake and pick flowers. It’s a great place to start if you’re new to the game. Just focus on picking flowers and growing your snake!

### Easy Stage
Ready for a bit more challenge? Friendly snakes will appear when you pick up mushrooms. These Friendly snakes will disappear when they meet the wall.

### Normal Stage
Things get more interesting! Bombs will appear when you pick up puzzle pieces. Be careful to avoid the bombs and keep your snake growing by catching the small animal and picking up puzzle pieces!

### Hard Stage
Step up for an exciting challenge! Your snake can pass through walls, and you’ll face larger disappearing animals and more frequent bombs. Keep an eye out for bombs thrown from outside the screen—they’ll keep you on your toes!

### Extreme Stage
Are you ready for the ultimate test? The Extreme Stage combines all the toughest elements. Only the best can survive this intense challenge!

## Future Improvements

There are several enhancements planned for the game, including:
- Improved colors and visual effects
- Adding audio elements for a richer experience
- Fixing collision detection issues

Despite these planned improvements, the game is fully playable and offers a lot of fun. I had a great time developing it and hope you enjoy playing it!
